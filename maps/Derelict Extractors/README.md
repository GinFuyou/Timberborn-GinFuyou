## Description

Three ancient towers are looming over wasteland. Weathered and rusty, they still stand firmly on a hill among rubble of forgotten facilities. Pumps, unreachable deep in boreholes inside no longer reach the ground waters during dry times, but when milder season comes unknown power source revs them back to life, dumping the water over the top and spilling mindlessly around, bringing life to desolate landscape.

Will you become the new master of derelict mechanisms that outlived their creators?
